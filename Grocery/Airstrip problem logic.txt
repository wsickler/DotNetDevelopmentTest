The name of the input file is entered by the user.
Assuming the file is in the same folder as the executable file.
Or the user will have to type the file path including the file name



File format:
First line is number of registers
Last register is trainee, which is 2 minutes per item

Customer type
Customer arrives
number of items customer has


Approach:
Process file contents
Create DataTable for customers
Add customers from file
Sort customers by StartTime, ItemCount, CustomerType
Create DataTable for registers
Insert values for total number of registers (RowCount = RegisterCount)
Iterate through customers and begin with StartTime 
process customers and assign to register
Determine time of arrival and completion and item count by minutes for each register and customers compared to current time
Remove customers from customers once process time has passed and update registers table values
End when all customers have been processed and removed
Calculate total completion time in register table and capture greatest value
display output

DataTables:

* Although using DataTables requires more overhead, using jagged arrays seem a bit more difficult to navigate

Customers:
CustomerType
StartTime
ItemCount
AssignedRegister
TimeMultiplier
TimeCompleted

Registers:
RegisterNumber
TimeMultiplier
TotalCustomers
TotalItemCount
LastCustomerItemCount
CurrentTime
CompletionTime
